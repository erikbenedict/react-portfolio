          Hello! My name is Erik Benedict and I enjoy creating things that live
          on the internet. My passion is mostly with the front-end, but I do
          have foundations in the back-end as well.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          My journey into web development started in 2021, tackling as many free
          online courses I could get my hands on. I fell in love and it became
          an obsession. It wasn&rsquo;t until 2023 that I started pursuing the
          idea of a career as a web developer, and decide to attend UNC Chapel
          Hill&rsquo;s full-stack coding bootcamp.

          As a previous self employed individual contractor, I went from fixing
          up homes to building homepages. Finding the same level of creativeness
          and sense of accomplishment in web development, I am continuously
          looking to expand my knowledge in front-end and full-stack programming
          to build bigger and better solutions for real-world problems, and to
          connect with like-minded developers and grow together.
